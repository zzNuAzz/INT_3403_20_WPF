## Exercises 5-1
> Write a program that displays an image consisting of parallel stripes, sitting above another image that’s pure gray. Make the gray level adjustable (by slider, buttons, keystrokes, or any other means you like). Stand far enough away that the stripes are indistinguishable from one another,and adjust(or have a friend adjust) the gray level of the solid rectangle until you say it matches the apparent gray of the stripes. Now move toward the display screen until you can detect the stripes individually; measure your distance from the display, and compute the angle subtended at your eye by a pair of parallel stripes. You should make sure that you’re not fooling yourself by having the display(after the press/click of a button) show either vertical or horizontal stripes next to the gray rectangle (at random) and have the position of the stripes and the solid rectangle exchanged or not (at random).
