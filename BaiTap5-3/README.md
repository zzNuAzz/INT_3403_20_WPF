## Exercises 5-3
> Write a program that draws three black dots of radius 0.25 at x = 0,1,2 along the x-axis. Then display instead three black dots at positions t,t + 1, and t + 2 (usingt = 0.25 initially). Make the display toggle back and forth between the two sets of dots, once every quarter-second. Do you tend to see the dots as moving? What if you increase t to 0.5? Include a slider that lets you adjust t from 0 to 3. Does the illusion of the dots moving ever weaken? When t = 1, you could interpret the motion as “the outer dot jumps back and forth from the far left(x = 0)to the far right (x = 3) while the middle two dots remain ﬁxed.” Can you persuade yourself that this is what you’re seeing? The strong impression that the dots are moving as a group is remarkably hard to abandon, supporting the Gestalt theory.
