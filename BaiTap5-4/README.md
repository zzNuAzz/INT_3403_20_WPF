## Exercises 5-4
>  Write a program to imitate Figure 5.13, where a slider controls the position of the red ball along its trajectory. Include a set of radio buttons that lets you change the “shadow” of the ball from an ellipse to a disk to a square to a small airplane shape, and see how the change affects your perception of the red ball’s position. You can write the program using the 3D test bed or the 2D test bed—there’s no particular need to get the perspective projection exactly right, so merely mimicking the ﬁgure will sufﬁce.
